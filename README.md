Should We Fear Meteors? 
A static visualization of meteors that can potentially impact with the Earth.

While the visualization is static, the final result is obtained using a simulation of physical forces. The gif below shows that process. The location of each circle (representing a meteor) on the horizontal axis is decided by it's radius (potential damage caused if the meteor were to impact with Earth). The location on the vertical axis, on the other hand, depends on the probability of impact. During the simulation, the meteors that have not yet impacted with Earth start from a fixed distance away from the center. The meteors that have a higher probability of impacting with Earth are more strongly pulled towards the center.

The answer? Not really, we shouldn't fear meteors.

This project was completed for the Data Visualization class at the University of Chicago in collaboration with Jose Arreluce and Dominic Dicarlo
